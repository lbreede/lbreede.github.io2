# Introduction

This document is the unofficial style guide for VEX, the high-performance expression language used inside Houdini.

# Conditionals and Loops

## If-Statements

Curly brackets are to be used for if-statements, regardless of amount of consequent statements. A single space is to be used before and after the condition, while the condition itself, should follow immediatly after the brackets.

    // Correct:

    // Correct spacing, placement of curly brackets and indentation.
    if (True) {
        do_something()
    }

    // Wrong:

    /*
    Use spaces between if and the opening curly bracket,
    but not after and before the closing and opening condition
    brackets respecively.
    */
    if( True ){
        do_something()
    }

    // For readability, don't add everything on the same line.
    if (True) do_something()

For if-else-statements, the else part is to be places one line below the closing curly bracket of the if part.

    // Correct:

    if (True) {
        do_something()
    }
    else {
        do_something_else()
    }

    // Wrong:

    // For readability, place the else part on a new line.
    if (True) {
        do_something()
    } else {
        do_something_else()
    }
