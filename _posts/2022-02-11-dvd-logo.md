An attempt to simulate the "Bouncing DVD Logo" (aka "DVD Screensaver") meme in Python with the pygame library.

<!--more-->

Recently, I've gotten more into Python's [pygame][pygame]{:target="_blank"} library during the research regarding a new personal project I'll be sharing here in the far future. That happened roughly at the same time as re-discovering the amazing [The Coding Train][the-coding-train]{:target="_blank"} channel on YouTube.

For the uninitiated, The Coding Train is a YouTube channel hosted by Daniel Shiffman, who tasks themselves with solving a so-called *Coding Challenge* using the p5.js library for JavaScript. Usually this has to be done in x amount of minutes (even though that's more of a suggestion than a rule) and during a livestream, leaving in every typo, debug, frustration and rejoice.

Naturally, being more of a Python person myself, I decided to recreate these challenges myself, usually before seeing Shiffman's approach, using pygame in Python.

For the [Coding Challenge #131][cc131]{:target="_blank"}, Shiffman successfully recreated the iconic DVD screensaver that bounces from side to side for everyone to cheer once it hit the corner perfectly.

Here is my version:
